MAJOR UPDATE
- To allow more customization in naming species
  * prepare_fasta_for_browser.py and prepare_gff_for_browser.py have been updated.
  * Call the specific programs for parameters/options.
  * For files being converted to bigwig, run format_file_names.py to rename chromosomes. Then convert to bigwig on the formatted file
  * All programs require name_formatting.py to be in the same directory.
  * All programs use the same name formatting parameters allowing specific formatting for chromosomes, scaffolds, contigs, chloroplast/mitochondria/lamba, and other chromosomes.
