MAJOR UPDATE
- To allow more customization in naming species, prepare_fasta_for_browser.py and prepare_gff_for_browser.py have been updated. They are still backwards compatible to previous versions. Call the specific programs for parameters/options. This requires the name_formatting.py file to be in the same directory.
